# Motu-and-Patlu CProgram

Problem Statement

Motu and Patlu are very good friends and they love to eat ice-creams.
Once they thought of playing a game, so they bought “n” ice-creams from the market of varying heights (may be same).
They arranged the ice-creams in a line in random order. Motu starts to eat ice-creams from left to right and Patlu from right to left. 
The heights of the ice-creams are known.
Motu eats the ice-cream as twice the speed of Patlu (that’s the secret for his health :p ).
If, anyone of them is eating the ice-cream , then definitely other one cannot have that ice-cream.
However, if both of them reach the same ice-cream, Motu snatches it away from Patlu (he got more power than patlu :( ) and eats it. 
The winner will be the one who will eat more number of ice-creams.
Since, both of them are too busy in eating ice-creams they forgot to count the number of ice-creams they have already eaten. Can you help them in deciding the winner.
